	abstract = {Despite machine learning models' success in Natural Language
	            Processing (NLP) tasks, predictions from these models
	            frequently fail on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Prior
	            works have focused on developing state-of-the-art methods for
	            detecting OOD. The fundamental question of how OOD samples
	            differ from indistribution samples remains unanswered. This
	            paper explores how data dynamics in training models can be
	            used to understand the fundamental differences between OOD
	            and in-distribution samples in extensive detail. We found
	            that syntactic characteristics of the data samples that the
	            model consistently predicts incorrectly in both OOD and
	            in-distribution cases directly contradict each other. In
	            addition, we observed preliminary evidence supporting the
	            hypothesis that models are more likely to latch on trivial
	            syntactic heuristics (e.g., overlap of words between two
	            sentences) when making predictions on OOD samples. We hope
	            our preliminary study accelerates the data-centric analysis
	            on various machine learning phenomena.},
